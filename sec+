Intimidation in cybersecurity is when an attacker uses fear or threats to scare someone into giving up information or access.

Consensus (Social Proof) Social Engineering

This is when an attacker tricks you by saying "everyone else is doing it." They use the power of the group to pressure you.

Simple Examples:
Fake Office Email:

"Hi, this is the IT team. All employees have already updated their passwords. Please click here to update yours now." (The link is fake).

Phishing Message:

"Hey! Most of the department has already signed up for the new benefits portal. Here's the link to register." (The portal is fake).

A phone call:

"This is the CFO's office. We are processing bonuses and all managers have confirmed their staff details. Can you verify your bank account number now?"

Scarcity Social Engineering

This is when an attacker creates a false sense of urgency or limited supply to make you act quickly without thinking.

Simple Examples:
Phishing Email:

"Last Chance! Your account will be permanently deleted in 24 hours unless you verify your details now!" (The link is fake).

Fake Alert:

"Emergency Security Update: A critical virus is attacking. You must install this patch immediately to protect your computer!" (The patch is malware).

Familiarity Social Engineering

This is when an attacker pretends to be someone you know or trust to trick you.

Simple Examples:
Pretending to be a Colleague:

"Hi, this is Sarah from accounting. We met at the party last week. Can you send me the project file? I need it urgently."

Business Email Compromise (BEC) is a type of scam where an attacker tricks a company into sending money or sensitive information by pretending to be a trusted person.

The "Attack Vector" metric answers the question: "What does the hacker need to reach the vulnerability?"
There are four levels, from easiest to hardest to exploit:
MEMORE:  PLAN 
PHYSICAL / SCORE: 0.20
LOCAL  / SCORE :  0.55
ADJACENT/ SCORE:  0.62
NETWORK / SCORE:  0.85

CVSS = Common Vulnerability Scoring System

It‚Äôs a standard way to rate how severe a security vulnerability is.

The exam expects you to know the rating scale and what the numbers mean.

üëâ The CVSS scale looks like this:

Score Range	Severity
0.0	None
0.1 ‚Äì 3.9	Low
4.0 ‚Äì 6.9	Medium
7.0 ‚Äì 8.9	High
9.0 ‚Äì 10.0	Critical

üìñ Why for the exam?
They might give you a scenario:

‚ÄúA vulnerability has a CVSS score of 9.5‚Äù ‚Üí you should know that‚Äôs Critical.

Or: ‚ÄúWhich vulnerability poses the greatest risk?‚Äù ‚Üí you compare by score.
