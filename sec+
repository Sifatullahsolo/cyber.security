Intimidation in cybersecurity is when an attacker uses fear or threats to scare someone into giving up information or access.

Consensus (Social Proof) Social Engineering

This is when an attacker tricks you by saying "everyone else is doing it." They use the power of the group to pressure you.

Simple Examples:
Fake Office Email:

"Hi, this is the IT team. All employees have already updated their passwords. Please click here to update yours now." (The link is fake).

Phishing Message:

"Hey! Most of the department has already signed up for the new benefits portal. Here's the link to register." (The portal is fake).

A phone call:

"This is the CFO's office. We are processing bonuses and all managers have confirmed their staff details. Can you verify your bank account number now?"

Scarcity Social Engineering

This is when an attacker creates a false sense of urgency or limited supply to make you act quickly without thinking.

Simple Examples:
Phishing Email:

"Last Chance! Your account will be permanently deleted in 24 hours unless you verify your details now!" (The link is fake).

Fake Alert:

"Emergency Security Update: A critical virus is attacking. You must install this patch immediately to protect your computer!" (The patch is malware).

Familiarity Social Engineering

This is when an attacker pretends to be someone you know or trust to trick you.

Simple Examples:
Pretending to be a Colleague:

"Hi, this is Sarah from accounting. We met at the party last week. Can you send me the project file? I need it urgently."
