NIST Cybersecurity Framework 5 core functions:  ### Shortcut: "IPDRR" 

Identify – Understand risks (assets, threats, policies).
Protect – Safeguard systems (access control, training, encryption).
Detect – Find threats early (monitoring, anomalies).
Respond – Act during/after incidents (containment, reporting).
Recover – Restore operations (backups, lessons learned).
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gap Analysis = Compare current security vs. ideal (NIST CSF goals), find missing pieces, and fix them.

3-Step Shortcut:
Where are we now? (Check tools/policies in place).   # Current: No backups.
Where should we be? (NIST’s 5 functions).   # Ideal: NIST "Recover" needs backups.
What’s missing? (Prioritize quick wins vs. long-term).   # Gap: Set up automated backups.
# Output: A simple table or list of gaps to fix. 🛠️
